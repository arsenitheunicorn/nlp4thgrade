your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh your way your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh why do i feel so let down when this is how it's always been may seem like a small thing now but it's deep under my skin 'cause when your mind's made up there's nothing i can do to change it and do you think your time is worth more than mine i'm still waiting i'm still waiting yeah and it's your way yeah your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh it's your way your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh standing where i'm supposed to be going nowhere thanks to you oh would it really put you out to make me feel significant 'cause when your mind's made up there's nothing i can do to change it and do you think your time is worth more than mine i'm still waiting i'm still waiting yeah and it's your way yeah your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh it's your way your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh don't don't don't make me wait don't don't don't make me wait why is it your way yeah your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh your way your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh why is it your way your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh your way your way or the rope or the rope oh oh oh don't don't don't haha make me wait,1
da da da can we keep it down bring the liquor and the reefer out there's no need to shout i'm chilling with my people now and everybody see we sleep on they couch and i ain't got a lot of money but i'm not feeling down i'm feeling proud that i'm still around i didn't drown in the shit i used to worry 'bout didn't frown when i used to turn my pockets out locking me down i've got me a sound loud popping and bounce city lights they blind my eyes when daylight is fading 'cause you've been all around town and i ain't had your loving babe still wanting every man's wish and i still got the heavy hand if i ever planned this you can bet i damn did it i tell it is when it isn't listen i'm wishing for different visions but snipping on slipping on slippery fingers thinking but it isn't as difficult when he i'm skipping this mission 'til the finish i'm snipping the ribbon you're borderline on everything and i'm all on nothing strange days be coming babe and i know i did nothing babe you can put your feet up you can get a but i'ma make a deep track and wait for the feedback i need to get my peas up no time to relax fucking up a relapse guess it's time for some beers bring my keys back i need to get my please bring the beat back so i can get my lyrics done i'm tryna live the dream and i ain't gonna live it up even if put you 'til i win enough city lights they blind my eyes when daylight is fading cause you've been all around town and i ain't had your loving babe you're borderline on everything and i'm all on nothing strange days be coming babe and i know i did nothing babe,1

i met this girl late last year she said don't you worry if i disappear i told her i'm not really looking for another mistake i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait but then i jump right in a week later returned i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn but i gave her my time for two or three nights then i put it on pause 'til the moment was right i went away for months until our paths crossed again she told me i was never looking for a friend maybe you could swing by my room around 10 baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin we'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am baby if you wanted me then you should've just said she's singing ah lah don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe ah lah don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe ah lahmlahlah for a couple weeks i only want to see her we drink away the days with a take away pizza before a text message was the only way to reach her now she's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her singing out aretha all over the track like a feature and never wants to sleep i guess that i don't want to either but me and her we make money the same way four cities two planes the same day ah those shows have never been what it's about but maybe we'll go together and just figure it out i'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch but we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now i wish i'd have written it down the way that things played out when she was kissing him how i was confused about she should figure it out while i'm sat here singing ah lah don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe ah lah don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe ah lahmlahlah on my hotel door i don't even know if she knows what for she was crying on my shoulder i already told ya trust and respect is what we do this for i never intended to be next but you didn't need to take him to bed that's all and i never saw him as a threat until you disappeared with him to have sex of course it's not like we were both on tour we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment but it was never just fun and i thought you were different this is not the way you realise what you wanted it's a bit too much too late if i'm honest all this time god knows i'm singing ah lah don't fuck with my love that heart is so cold all over my home i don't wanna know that babe ah lah don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe ah lah don't fuck with my love these girls ain't loyal that heart is so cold this girl ain't loyal ah lah don't fuck with my love i told her she knows take aim and reload i don't wanna know that babe ah lahmlahlah shorty get down good lord baby got 'em open all over town strictly biz she don't play around cover much grounds got game by the pound getting paid is her forte each and every day true player way i can't get her outta my mind i think about the girl all the time east side to

heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo damn that girl looks good heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play a guitar just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder in any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder under the covers where we used to lay and re stacks is what the speakers played i'd be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching the dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe we used each other's air just for the people to see and stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep we'd go anywhere our minds would take us and i said you are beautiful without your make up and you don't even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way that god made us and time's the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i'm away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake say it again oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina oh won't you leave me now now and every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone watching blue planet creating new habits then as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can't help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you'll be in between forever so i guess we'll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i'm not saying we should be taking a break just re evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in a day we'll have to say it again oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both nina uh won't you leave me now now love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won't you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back go oh won't you leave me now oh nina you should go nina 'cause i ain't never coming home nina oh won't you leave me now and i've been living on the road nina and then again you should know nina cause that's you and me both in a road won't you leave me now now,1

hey guys let me start by apologizing to you for the way everything went down on saturday i had a statement typed ready to post to you guys but hayley released one without my permission we were not going to issue a statement until we worked out our exit agreement with hayley i wish it didn’t have to happen that way zac and i wanted to be the ones you heard it from i want to be honest with you guys about how this band formulated from day one i did not think hayley’s version told the whole story at least from our perspective and hopefully this will explain a bit about why we are leaving zac and i had a garage band in high school with the intentions of just making music for the love of it we met taylor and our friend jason clark at our school and found out that we shared the same musical tastes so we asked them to join our band it was some of the greatest times of our lives playing music in taylor’s basement with them we obviously needed a lead singer and one day zac met hayley we asked her to come try out and eventually to join the band months down the road things changed and this band became all about hayley she had a manager at the time that controlled her every move along with her parents they didn’t like the idea of hayley being in a rock band so they forced her to leave wanting her to pursue a solo career hayley went off to write and record her solo demos while the four of us continued on without her a couple of months later hayley came and asked us if she could use the song “conspiracy” that we had all previously written together we agreed that that would be fine i got a call a while after that from hayley telling me that her manager said that zac and i were invited to be back in the band but not taylor and jason because they weren’t good enough in his eyes hayley brought in jeremy and our first rhythm guitarist jason bynum as the other two members we travelled to la a few weeks later for a showcase and it was a nightmare hayley’s manager would tell the band to be in the lobby of the hotel at a certain time but he and hayley wouldn’t show for hours we found out that they had been meeting with record label executives all morning without us which is totally weird given that this wasn’t simply a solo artist but we were a band the band was in the dark the whole time after many meetings between hayley her manager and the labels they decided to sign her to atlantic records we didn’t understand why hayley was the only one signing the contract since we were told this was a “band” but we were too young to grasp all of this so far zac and i haven’t signed with another label although i guess our part of paramore sure could next thing we knew we were having a signing party for hayley our next move was to rerecord her solo demos with our own music rather than studio musicians to make it sound more genuine meanwhile we tossed around band names i wrote out a list of names including “paramore” a name my old band with taylor and jason clark had thought about using obviously we settled on that name the label received the rerecorded demos and once again tried to fire the entire band saying we were terrible thankfully hayley and i had been writing some new songs together that the label was pleased with so that acted as leverage for the band to stay the label and management then decided to build our band up the grass roots route they put hayley on fueled by ramen not making it known she was signed to atlantic as well all the while we still questioned whether or not we were an actual band but hayley continued to insist we were despite our being ignored and pushed around by the label they then sent us all to orlando to rehearse and write eight hours a day for our first record half way though this process jeremy decided to quit we were all really upset about it so we finished the record replaced jeremy and hit the road with hayley’s father as our tour manager/driver of a twelve passenger van her dad would constantly threaten to “pull the plug” on the whole band if we complained about anything suggesting that we were hired guns and hayley was the real artist when in reality we were also part of the band we’ve always been treated as less important than hayley it’s been obvious how her family views things jeremy ended up rejoining and we toured non stop for two and half years building our fan base pretending to be a band that started naturally in reality what started as natural somehow morphed into a manufactured product of a major label riding on the coattails of “hayley’s dream” before recording our next record we kicked out jeremy for his lack of work ethic and participation in things that zac hayley and i didn’t agree with at this point it was just the three of us to record riot once the record was done we needed a bassist and another guitarist eventually zac and i convinced hayley to let taylor rejoin and she convinced us to let jeremy back in promising he had changed his ways once again we hit the road and toured on our biggest record as a band as you all know hayley and i dated and broke up during this album cycle things then started going downhill for our band hayley and jeremy’s views started changing from what we all once believed in the band almost split after cancelling a tour in europe but we managed to keep it together somehow this is when zac and i started to consider quitting the band once we finished touring on riot we came home for a break and started writing for brand new eyes hayley presented lyrics to us that were really negative and we didn’t agree with for example “the truth never set me free” which contradicts what the bible says in john 832 we fought her about how her lyrics misrepresented our band and what we stood for but in the end she got her way instead of fighting her any longer we decided to just roll over and let it go hayley claimed that this record reunited us as band and made us grow closer together when in reality we were all growing further apart suddenly the band had spilt into two sides touring became more difficult since we couldn’t agree on anything the friendships our band once had were no longer existent amos 33 says “can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction” in addition to the band turmoil touring had really taken its toll on us both we left home at such a young age and missed taking part in normal teenage years when you own part of a band and are constantly playing you make sacrifices touring has taken its toll on our family members as well i specifically remember many moments where our parents would break down in tears when we had to leave it broke my heart seeing our siblings grow up so much during our absences was never easy either after a lot a prayer and counsel zac and i came to the decision that it was time to leave the band we truly feel that god is leading us elsewhere and is going to do great things with us the intention of this statement was not to belittle or disgrace the rest of the band it was simply to clarify our decision for leaving and our desire to finally tell you guys the truth we are still hoping to work out a friendly way to leave our part of paramore intact with the remaining band members including hayley we want to thank you guys for all of your love and support over the past 7 years it’s been an honor creating and playing music for you if music is what god calls us to in the future we hope that you all will be a part of it all of the glory be to god josh and zac,0

"it's jingleball there’s santa hats everywhere you're never too far away from one and you know i was wondering if maybe you wanted me to sing a song that i wrote my winter nights are taken up by static stress and holiday shopping traffic but i close my eyes and i'm somewhere else just like magic in my heart is a christmas tree farm where the people would come to dance under sparkling lights bundled up in their mittens and coats and the cider would flow and i just wanna be there tonight sweet dreams of holly and ribbon mistakes are forgiven and everythin’ is icy and blue and you would be there too under the mistletoe watchin' the fire glow and tellin' me ""i love you"" just bein' in your arms takes me back to that little farm where every wish comes true in my heart is a christmas tree farm there's a light in the barn we run inside out from the cold in the town kids are dreamin' of sleighs and they're warm and they're safe they wake to see a blanket of snow sweet dreams of holly and ribbon mistakes are forgiven and everythin’ is icy and blue and you would be there too under the mistletoe watchin’ the fire glow and tellin' me ""i love you"" just bein’ in your arms takes me back to that little farm where every wish comes true baby yeah and when i'm feelin' alone you remind me of home oh baby baby merry christmas and when the world isn't fair i pretend that we’re there baby baby merry christmas under the mistletoe watching the fire glow and tellin' me ""i love you"" oh baby baby merry christmas oh baby baby merry christmas oh baby baby merry christmas i love you oh baby baby merry christmas oh baby baby merry christmas oh baby baby merry christmas where every wish comes true i love you",0

"according to my birth certificate i turn 30 this year it's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283 but the actual age i currently am is 29 i've heard people say that your thirties are ""the most fun"" so i'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought i'd share some lessons i've learned before reaching 30 because it's 2019 and sharing is caring lesson 1 i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t how you’re failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way i’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life but i’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look 🔥🔥🔥 i’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while i’m having my coffee at nine in the morning i think it’s healthy for your self esteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once lesson 2 being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you lesson 3 trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture but that said it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks it’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching that’s good we’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now that’s not what i said or do it whatever maybe you’ll learn from it then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again but it’s fine do you you’re searching lesson 4 i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day lesson 5 banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isn’t cruel it’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it lesson 6 i’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age it’s an impossible standard to meet and i’ve been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity time and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men lesson 7 my biggest fear after the manchester arena bombing and the vegas concert shooting i was completely terrified to go on tour this time because i didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months there was a tremendous amount of planning expense and effort put into keeping my fans safe my fear of violence has continued into my personal life i carry quikclot army grade bandage dressing which is for gunshot or stab wounds websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address i’ve ever had online you get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things every day i try to remind myself of the good in the world the love i’ve witnessed and the faith i have in humanity we have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears lesson 8 i learned not to let outside opinions establish the value i place on my own life choices for too long the projected opinions of strangers affected how i viewed my relationships whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture i posted on instagram that stuff isn’t real for an approval seeker like me it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my own value system of what i actually want lesson 9 i learned how to make some easy cocktails like pimm’s cups aperol spritzes old fashioneds and mojitos because…2016 lesson 10 i’ve always cooked a lot but i found three recipes i know i’ll be making at dinner parties for life ina garten’s real meatballs and spaghetti nigella lawson’s mughlai chicken and jamie oliver’s chicken fajitas with molé sauce getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer i also learned how to immediately calculate celsius to fahrenheit in my head lesson 11 recently i discovered command tape and i definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if i’d hung things that way all along this is not an ad i just really love command tape lesson 12 apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you even if it was unintentional it’s so easy to just apologize and move on try not to say “i’m sorry but” and make excuses for yourself learn how to make a sincere apology and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships lesson 13 it’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault i believe the victim coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through i know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing awful experience i believe victims because i know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “this happened to me” it’s something no one would choose for themselves we speak up because we have to and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t lesson 14 when tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear it’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them you don’t have all the answers however it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point even if you can’t really help the situation it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could lesson 15 vitamins make me feel so much better i take l theanine which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety i also take magnesium for muscle health and energy lesson 16 before you jump in headfirst maybe i don’t knowget to know someone all that glitters isn’t gold and first impressions actually aren’t everything it’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what i know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them but the layers of a person you discover in time are they honest self aware and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it do they show up for you when you need them do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people these are things a first impression could never convey lesson 17 after my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a sharpie as eyeliner i felt like i needed to start being nicer to my skin i now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after i shower not just in the winter but all year round because why can’t i be soft during all the seasons lesson 18 realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them for example never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me even as an adult i still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at in my twenties i found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend so i shouted it from the rooftops posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood without realizing that other people might still feel the way i did when i felt so alone it’s important to address our long standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them lesson 19 playing mind games is for the chase in a real relationship or friendship you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel and what could be done to fix it no one is a mind reader if someone really loves you they want you to verbalize how you feel this is real life not chess lesson 20 learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships something about “we’re in our young twenties” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family and maybe they will be for the rest of your life or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase but not forever it’s sad but sometimes when you grow you outgrow relationships you may leave behind friendships along the way but you’ll always keep the memories lesson 21 fashion is all about playful experimentation if you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe you’re doing it wrong see bleachella lesson 22 how to fight fair with the ones you love chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you if you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight i know a couple who in the thick of a fight say “hey same team” find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built they don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship they just give out divorce papers lesson 23 i learned that i have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if i’m #canceled they were there in the worst times and they’re here now the fans and their care for me my well being and my music were the ones who pulled me through the most emotional part of the reputation stadium tour for me was knowing i was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up i’ll never forget the ones who stuck around lesson 24 i’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family both of my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again it’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else my mom’s cancer is a real problem i used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs i give all of my worry stress and prayers to real problems now lesson 25 i remember people asking me “what are you gonna write about if you ever get happy” there’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art that art and suffering go hand in hand i’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool lesson 26 i make countdowns for things i’m excited about when i’ve gone through dark low times i’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app and adding things i’m looking forward to even if they’re not big holidays or anything it’s good to look toward the future sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on to better things lesson 27 i learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh in my experience i’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously a few years ago someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet the fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than i’ve ever felt in my life but i can’t tell you how hard i had to keep from laughing every time my 63 foot inflatable cobra named karyn appeared onstage in front of 60000 screaming fans it’s the stadium tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful instagram comment with “lol” it would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us but maybe all i’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing i could survive it and thrive in spite of it lesson 28 i’m finding my voice in terms of politics i took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day to day life i saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk and felt like i had to speak up to try and help make a change only as someone approaching 30 did i feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what i want from our leaders and i realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric i’m going to do more to help we have a big race coming up next year lesson 29 i learned that your hair can completely change texture from birth i had the curliest hair and now it is straight it’s the straight hair i wished for every day in junior high but just as i was coming to terms with loving my curls they’ve left me please pray for their safe return lesson 30 my mom always tells me that when i was a little kid she never had to punish me for misbehaving because i would punish myself even worse i’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself as a five year old i realized that i do the same thing now when i feel i’ve made a mistake whether it’s self imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating i’ve come to a realization that i need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice trusting the wrong person or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone step into the daylight and let it go",0
