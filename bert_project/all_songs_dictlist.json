Is it a threat, or the cure? 'Cause it's a brave new world I don't know if I'm ready for Just a test 'Cause I'm miles up above you, flying with no safety net I don't believe in fate, although this time, I think I've met my match Why are the dreams so hard to catch? 'Cause you forget in time what it feels inside When you live right on the line, but I'm so alive! They say, believing is the hardest part But I say, with every beat of my heart I alone, will find my way And get right back to the start They say, the fire in your heart is gone Well, I say, it's really only just begun All along, you know that I'm I'm twisted by design, I'm twisted by design Taking the days as they come But now, I'm seeing the world as if it had a thousand sounds Oh, I admit, oh, that they're somewhere along the lines I guess I lost my grip But luck has turned the page, and time is up, I need to get things Right, one more chance to catch the light Cause you forget in time what it feels inside When you live right on the line, but I'm so alive! They say, believing is the hardest part But I say, with every beat of my heart I alone, will find my way And get right back to the start They say, the fire in your heart is gone Well, I say, it's really only just begun All along, you know that I'm I'm twisted by design, I'm twisted by design Starting over again, but the further I get I can't stop these walls from closing in Going out of my head, all the tears that I bled They're not enough to take my pain away! They say, believing is the hardest part But I say, with every beat of my heart I alone, will find my way And get right back to the start They say, the fire in your heart is gone Well, I say, it's really only just begun All along, you know that I'm I'm twisted by design In some ways I've changed And I've left it all behind But I can't change the way That I'm twisted by design"

Or were you not aware? Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while Who's gonna make you fall in love? I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose Well I don't want to lose it either But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly? Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out Who's gonna make you fall in love? I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall I will catch you if you fall I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself Fall in love I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love But you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby"

I don't wanna be the one Be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon Take this weapon, forged in darkness Some see a pen, I see a harpoon How are you all feeling so far? Good? Alright cool We're gonna get going, let's do this 'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight Oh, oh, oh yeah Why am I not scared in the morning? I don't hear those voices calling I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out I swear I heard demons yelling Those crazy words they were spelling They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone But I tell 'em, why won't you let me go Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'll tell 'em On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate The start of a day when we put on our face A mask that portrays that we don't need grace On the eve of a day that is bigger than us But we open our eyes, cause we're told that we must And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead Desperately yelling, \"There's something we need!\" I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime I'm afraid to tell you who I adore Won't tell you who I'm singing towards Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four Whoa I'll stay awake cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight Oh yeah Why am I not scared in the morning?

Ain't nobody holding you back Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? Your heart don't stand a chance Your knees just want to break Your eyes keep me all in a trance And let me ask you I know the approach is so far from what you're used to But you know it And do I hold a candle to the last one over your moon? Baby, of course I do And I'm not closing my tab Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? Your heart don't stand a chance Ooh, champagne pourin' down Arms, legs wrapped around you Ooh, champagne, let it fall down Arms, legs keep grabbing Two-step in the corridor Spinning the greatest hits of Hall & Oates Open of chronic smoke I know my time will flee But your heart don't stand a chance It feels like it's been far too long The moment is all that we have My meter should be up by the half A ticket is the least of my cares So let me ask you Am I dreaming? Mind on a tip of a cloud Or is it real as the stone in your crown? Say, ain't nobody towing my Jag Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? Your heart don't stand a chance I'm waiting for the white flag You're talking with the blunt in your hand And won't you pass that? I know, in the morning The sunlight cover your wounds But I'm hoping that I look the same as the way you always knew Baby, your course, I flew But I'm not over what we had Don't it feel like it's been far too long, girl? Your heart don't stand a chance Ooh, champagne pourin' down Arms, legs wrapped around you Ooh, champagne, let it fall down Arms, legs keep grabbing I remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was And looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water"

Text from the source, sending you a blessing Sense me in the presence, ponder my question I love my shit, yeah I swear I do If I love myself, would you love me too I mean I love my shit, I swear I do If I love myself, would you love me too 'Cause I hate myself when I'm not with you See me down when I'm out and I'm black when I'm blue If it don't feel right then it can't be true 'Cause there's nothing I can do when I think of you Ladies and gentlemen We are now approaching our final descent Please buckle your seatbelts And thank you for riding with ZFK and Face to face, no time to waste Tongue trace your body 'til it finds the space Rotate your waist, longer our pace Lips meet in place for a warm embrace It was J, Jane, and me, rolling in the G F.U.C.Katz.I.N.G First came J, then came Jane Then came Zebra, ain't a damn thing changed It was J, Jane, and me, rolling in the G F.U.C.Katz.I.N.G First came J, then came Jane Then came Zebra, ain't a damn thing changed Ain't a damn thing changed Hello hi are you the one One I've been searching and waiting for I've been looking for you for so damn long Couldn't numb the pain with the hit from the bong Now I'm going through the emotions and it feels so wrong I've been daily catching feelings so I wrote this song In a hotel room overseas on tour Where I'm feeling myself 'cause I'm all alone"

I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some My father called me to tell me he loved me— I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker I'll see you in a couple, OF I told her I'm her worst nightmare This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair My spirit floats around in the night air Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems I told her I'm her worst nightmare This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair My spirit floats around in the night air Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe? All because a nigga just don't give a fuck Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh Feel like I missed my little brother growing up Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up But I never had a drink— My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm As emotionally straight as Travis when he-- Don't look at me, I'm 6'5\", about to fucking cry About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die I finally had a family Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley? Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me? Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death One ear I got kids screaming, \"O.F. is the best\" The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at So I can kill these levels of stress, shit They say that I'm shock value How about you hop off cock and turn volume down? I haven't got around to telling my mom shit Cause I don't know how to... All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees And deodorant like his house is my home I could live with the same hat And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday Where I skate with the same fucking friends that Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh \"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat\" Email full of emails, I never write back Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back I told her I'm her worst nightmare This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair My spirit floats around in the night air Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops I'm going in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry Nigga, get off me Fuck off me man, fuck I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not It's like I got a fucking voice in my head Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man I don't fucking know, man He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do Tron Cat"

Turn the headphones up When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it But I could never rewrite history in a coffin So I'm talking to God, \"Can you wash all these demons off me?\" This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, \"Kendrick, just persevere The presence of being real\" As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles Thinking, \"How can I make an example for this generation of Compton?\" My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished Or turning back to that same accomplice My past life was a child with no act right Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent Assuring that some blossom early and some truant Thank God for the album I idolized It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage And thought we was Jay and Dame That's the lane that we tried to drive Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse My nigga got hit 25 times with a K Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought Q ain't got a place to stay and 'bout to sleep on the couch We eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort But I ain't need it I never screamed out \"the New West,\" I didn't believe it They brought each other down, I was planning out my achievements I need to separate myself to stand out I need a better way to take your fans now I need to kill you motherfuckers dead Three hollow tips aimed at your head I'll be damned if the chopper jam now And we never asked for no hand out In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how We could never resolve in the hall of fame And I went to the trial with a Bible and a rifle I play the game as I blam blow Hollaback at me, nigga And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga? 'Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix 'Cause falling off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious I need to separate myself to stand out I need a better way to take your fans now I need to kill you motherfuckers dead Three hollow tips aimed at your head I'll be damned if the chopper jam now And we never asked for no hand out I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out Looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport The homies was still poor, was working at Jansport Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre? Even Vanessa from XXL had told him press play And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit Rapped with my forefathers, even wreck it with Gaga too Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true Thought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose I was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup Cool, 'cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof I came, I saw, I conquered No shame, I blame all of this on Compton Thinkin' 'bout when Sherane tried to set me up Cold game, full circle, they set up her I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong The story was short film, the glory of him and them The worry of mothers that don't recover when baby's killed The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd? Will you let hip-hop die on October 22nd?"

            "Album": "",
            "Lyrics": "Hey guys, Let me start by apologizing to you for the way everything went down on Saturday. I had a statement typed ready to post to you guys but Hayley released one without my permission. We were not going to issue a statement until we worked out our exit agreement with Hayley. I wish it didn’t have to happen that way, Zac and I wanted to be the ones you heard it from. I want to be honest with you guys about how this band formulated from day one. I did not think Hayley’s version told the whole story, at least from our perspective and hopefully this will explain a bit about why we are leaving. Zac and I had a garage band in high school with the intentions of just making music for the love of it. We met Taylor and our friend Jason Clark at our school and found out that we shared the same musical tastes. So, we asked them to join our band. It was some of the greatest times of our lives playing music in Taylor’s basement with them. We obviously needed a lead singer and one day Zac met Hayley. We asked her to come try out and eventually to join the band. Months down the road things changed and this band became all about Hayley. She had a manager at the time that controlled her every move along with her parents. They didn’t like the idea of Hayley being in a rock band so they forced her to leave wanting her to pursue a solo career. Hayley went off to write and record her solo demos while the four of us continued on without her. A couple of months later Hayley came and asked us if she could use the song “Conspiracy” that we had all previously written together. We agreed that that would be fine. I got a call a while after that from Hayley telling me that her manager said that Zac and I were invited to be back in the band , but not Taylor and Jason because they weren’t good enough in his eyes. Hayley brought in Jeremy and our first rhythm guitarist Jason Bynum as the other two members. We travelled to LA a few weeks later for a showcase and it was a nightmare. Hayley’s manager would tell the band to be in the lobby of the hotel at a certain time, but he and Hayley wouldn’t show for hours. We found out that they had been meeting with record label executives all morning without us, which is totally weird given that this wasn’t simply a solo artist, but we were a band. The band was in the dark the whole time. After many meetings between Hayley, her manager and the labels they decided to sign her to Atlantic records. We didn’t understand why Hayley was the only one signing the contract since we were told this was a “band”, but we were too young to grasp all of this. So far, Zac and I haven’t signed with another label, although I guess our part of Paramore sure could. Next thing we knew we were having a signing party for Hayley. Our next move was to rerecord her solo demos with our own music rather than studio musicians to make it sound more genuine. Meanwhile, we tossed around band names. I wrote out a list of names, including “Paramore”, a name my old band with Taylor and Jason Clark had thought about using. Obviously, we settled on that name. The label received the rerecorded demos and once again tried to fire the entire band, saying we were terrible. Thankfully Hayley and I had been writing some new songs together that the label was pleased with so that acted as leverage for the band to stay. The label and management then decided to build our band up the grass-roots route. They put Hayley on Fueled by Ramen not making it known she was signed to Atlantic as well. All the while we still questioned whether or not we were an actual band, but Hayley continued to insist we were, despite our being ignored and pushed around by the label. They then sent us all to Orlando to rehearse and write eight hours a day for our first record. Half -way though this process, Jeremy decided to quit. We were all really upset about it. So we finished the record, replaced Jeremy, and hit the road with Hayley’s father as our tour manager/driver of a twelve-passenger van. Her dad would constantly threaten to “pull the plug” on the whole band if we complained about anything, suggesting that we were hired guns and Hayley was the real artist, when in reality we were also part of the band. We’ve always been treated as less important than Hayley. It’s been obvious how her family views things. Jeremy ended up rejoining and we toured non-stop for two and half years building our fan base, pretending to be a band that started naturally. In reality, what started as natural somehow morphed into a manufactured product of a major label, riding on the coattails of “Hayley’s dream.” Before recording our next record, we kicked out Jeremy for his lack of work ethic and participation in things that Zac, Hayley and I didn’t agree with. At this point it was just the three of us to record Riot. Once the record was done, we needed a bassist and another guitarist. Eventually Zac and I convinced Hayley to let Taylor rejoin and she convinced us to let Jeremy back in, promising he had changed his ways. Once again we hit the road and toured on our biggest record as a band. As you all know Hayley and I dated and broke up during this album cycle. Things then started going downhill for our band. Hayley and Jeremy’s views started changing from what we all once believed in. The band almost split after cancelling a tour in Europe, but we managed to keep it together somehow. This is when Zac and I started to consider quitting the band. Once we finished touring on Riot, we came home for a break and started writing for Brand New Eyes. Hayley presented lyrics to us that were really negative and we didn’t agree with. For example, “the truth never set me free”, which contradicts what the Bible says in John 8:32 . We fought her about how her lyrics misrepresented our band and what we stood for, but in the end she got her way. Instead of fighting her any longer, we decided to just roll over and let it go. Hayley claimed that this record reunited us as band and made us grow closer together, when in reality we were all growing further apart. Suddenly the band had spilt into two sides. Touring became more difficult since we couldn’t agree on anything. The friendships our band once had were no longer existent. Amos 3:3 says, “Can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction”. In addition to the band turmoil, touring had really taken its toll on us both. We left home at such a young age and missed taking part in normal teenage years. When you own part of a band and are constantly playing, you make sacrifices. Touring has taken its toll on our family members as well. I specifically remember many moments where our parents would break down in tears when we had to leave. It broke my heart. Seeing our siblings grow up so much during our absences was never easy either. After a lot a prayer and counsel Zac and I came to the decision that it was time to leave the band. We truly feel that God is leading us elsewhere and is going to do great things with us. The intention of this statement was not to belittle or disgrace the rest of the band, it was simply to clarify our decision for leaving and our desire to finally tell you guys the truth. We are still hoping to work out a friendly way to leave our part of Paramore intact with the remaining band members, including Hayley. We want to thank you guys for all of your love and support over the past 7 years. It’s been an honor creating and playing music for you. If music is what God calls us to in the future, we hope that you all will be a part of it. All of the glory be to God, Josh and Zac"

I had a studio on the top and in the living room we pushed all the chairs out of the way and made a station down there where I can play the real piano. It feels good people to just play the real piano sometimes. We were just writing, playing off with each other. And that groove just started happening, that verse between Tim and Terry. And I was like, 'oh cool.' And I kind of took to the next part, I was playing what now is the chorus. All of the sudden they got all excited and I was like, 'really? That's the chorus? I don't know, we didn't even try that hard.' 'No, that was really good.' Yeah, I love that song. It's catchy and fun. I loved it, it's gonna be the first single. It's different for us. I feel like it's a good representation of Evanescence now. It still sounds like that band, it's heavy. But at the time it's not trying to be heavy. It's fun, the vocals are fun. I'm excited about it.\""

            "Lyrics": "According to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are \"the most fun!\" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring. Lesson 1 I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t, how you’re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while I’m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once. Lesson 2 Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you. Lesson 3 Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture . BUT THAT SAID, it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That’s GOOD. We’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That’s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you’ll learn from it. Then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it’s fine; do you, you’re searching. Lesson 4 I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day. Lesson 5 Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn’t cruel. It’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it. Lesson 6 I’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet, and I’ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men. Lesson 7 My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears. Lesson 8 I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn’t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want. Lesson 9 I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm’s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016. Lesson 10 I’ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I’ll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten’s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti , Nigella Lawson’s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver’s Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. Lesson 11 Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I’d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape. Lesson 12 Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships. Lesson 13 It’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.” It’s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t. Lesson 14 When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before, it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don’t have all the answers. However, it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point. Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could. Lesson 15 Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy. Lesson 16 Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don’t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn’t gold, and first impressions actually aren’t everything. It’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them , but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken? Or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people? These are things a first impression could never convey. Lesson 17 After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner , I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can’t I be soft during all the seasons?! Lesson 18 Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them. Lesson 19 Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess. Lesson 20 Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about “we’re in our young twenties!” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories. Lesson 21 Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you’re doing it wrong. See: Bleachella. Lesson 22 How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say “Hey, same team.” Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers. Lesson 23 I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I’m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they’re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I’ll never forget the ones who stuck around. Lesson 24 I’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now. Lesson 25 I remember people asking me, “What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?” There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool. Lesson 26 I make countdowns for things I’m excited about. When I’ve gone through dark, low times, I’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app and adding things I’m looking forward to. Even if they’re not big holidays or anything, it’s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things. Lesson 27 I learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I’ve ever felt in my life, but I can’t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It’s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful Instagram comment with “lol.” It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it. Lesson 28 I’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year. Lesson 29 I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It’s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they’ve left me. Please pray for their safe return. Lesson 30 My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I’ve made a mistake, whether it’s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I’ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go."
